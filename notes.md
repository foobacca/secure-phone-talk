Talks notes
===========

We have one hour and I want youto have time to play with the tools so I'm not going to talk about why you should be worried - that's covered in other sessions.

The plan is to talk about:

* what the threats are
* what tools are available to manage the threats

and then split up and start installing, setting up and using those tools
