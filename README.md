# Securing Your Phone Talk

## Compiling and viewing the presentation

The core of the talk is in `talk.md` and is intended to be processed by [mdpress](http://egonschiele.github.io/mdpress/) (which converts markdown into [impress.js](http://bartaz.github.io/impress.js) presentations) - so:

```
gem install mdpress
mdpress -r talk.md
```

`mdpress -r` will compile the presentation and open it in your browser.  You can then make it full screen and press space to go through the slides.

While [notes.md](notes.md) contains notes not shown on screen.
